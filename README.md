# lunchbot
A customizable bot for helping to decide what's for lunch

To test and debug locally, run

    make run

The service is hosted on [Heroku](https://what-about-lunch.herokuapp.com). Currently, only the menu of [Cafe Magdalen](https://www.oxfordsp.com/parklife/magdalen-centre/) can be parsed.

To get the daily lunch menu, go to 

[https://what-about-lunch.herokuapp.com/cafe_magdalen/](https://what-about-lunch.herokuapp.com/cafe_magdalen/)

Or, if you're interested in a menu for a specific day - i.e. **wednesday**, go to 

[https://what-about-lunch.herokuapp.com/cafe_magdalen/wednesday](https://what-about-lunch.herokuapp.com/cafe_magdalen/wednesday)
